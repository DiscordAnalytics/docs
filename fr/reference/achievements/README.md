## The Achievement store

With "The Achievement Update", we added a new way to create achievement by copying an achievement shared by the community.

Here is what you can do with a copied achievement:

| Permission                           | Allowed for copied achievements |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Delete the achievement               | ✅                               |
| Edit the achievement                 | ❌                               |
| Publish the achievement to the store | ❌                               |
